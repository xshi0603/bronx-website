### Neighborhood Rankings

  Reviewing services like Yelp and TripAdvisor have gained traction over the years, consolidating user opinions to provide evaluations of businesses and attractions. Similarly, Niche, DNAInfo, Brick Underground, Curbed, Buzzfeed, and StreetAdvisor have created a similar system in which NYC neighborhoods are ranked in terms of desirability.
  
  When considering a neighborhood’s overall ranking, there are large overlaps and similarities setting a base standard for a neighborhood’s desirability. Many different rankings take safety into consideration, with neighborhood scores accounting for crime rates and traffic conditions. Another make-or-break factor across the board is convenience for residents: transportation and  “walkability” are a priority for almost everyone looking into a neighborhood since those are universal points of entry. Linked with age, income, and gentrification, a neighborhood’s popularity or “cool factor” also seems to be an important element for multiple outlets. With such a variety of judging categories to choose from, many assessments differ in that they point out niche characteristics of a neighborhood that would be a unique preference to smaller demographics. For example, internet access and nightlife are components stressed upon with websites catering to a demographic of young adults, whereas parent approvability, schools, and diversity are geared towards family units. As a group, we prefer rankings that apply to a broader range of individuals like Niche and StreetAdvisor. While quizzes like Buzzfeed’s add an element of interactivity, they are incredibly tailored to aesthetics and individual taste and cannot provide a reliable ranking that can be understood by a large audience. 
  
  Within the borough of Bronx, each of our neighborhoods remained fairly consistent with average Niche rankings hovering around C. Based on our personal ranking priorities for outdoor dining however, our neighborhoods fared better. Since NYC remains a hotspot metropolitan sprawl regardless of the borough, nightlife and diversity were praised across the board (A+ to B+), with a large variety of locations open at virtually every hour of the day. Additionally, the Bronx was rated incredibly highly in terms of walkability and access to transportation; our neighborhoods combined the convenience of bus services, subway services, and residential walkways making them an ideal candidate for anyone looking to stop by. Although crime rates are not perfect, the Bronx has improved its safety measures exponentially over the past decade. Many of our neighborhoods, such as Belmont, have been praised for their tight-knit community and have reported a crime rate drop of 66% between 1993 and 2010. With these factors in mind, neighborhoods and their restaurants within the Bronx seem to be strong contenders in the world of outdoor dining.

### Borough Data Analysis

![Graph1](/Graph1.png)

This graph displays the number of restaurants based on two different categories, the borough and whether the restaurant serves on the sidewalk, roadway, or on both. We can see that Manhattan has the highest number of restaurants overall and that the Bronx falls behind every borough besides Staten Island in the number of restaurants. However, something to note is that a majority of Bronx restaurants serve both on the sidewalks and on the roadways.

This graph displays the average sidewalk area by borough in New York City. The main point to take away from this graph is that the Bronx has the highest average sidewalk area in all of the boroughs. Because of this, we can see why the Bronx has such a low amount of restaurants that only offer services on the roadway from the previous graph.

This graph displays the number of restaurants based on two different categories, the borough and whether the restaurant serves alcohol or not. We can see that Manhattan has the highest number of restaurants overall and that the Bronx falls behind every borough besides Staten Island in the number of restaurants. However, something to note is that a fairly even percentage of restaurants in the Bronx serve alcohol in the Bronx compared to the dominating percentage in the other boroughs.
